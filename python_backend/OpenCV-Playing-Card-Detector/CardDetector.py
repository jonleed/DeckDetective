### ---- INITIALIZATION ---- ###
# Define constants and initialize variables

# Initialize variables for counting
running_count = 0
total_cards_seen = 0
number_of_decks = 1  # Adjust based on your game setup
total_cards_in_shoe = number_of_decks * 52
counted_cards = set() # Set to store tuples of (Rank, Suit)

# Initialize last known rank and suit
last_known_rank = None
last_known_suit = None

# Initialize a list to store cards from the previous frame
previous_cards = []
next_card_id = 1  # Counter to assign unique IDs to cards

## Camera settings
IM_WIDTH = 1280
IM_HEIGHT = 720 
FRAME_RATE = 10

## Initialize calculated frame rate because it's calculated AFTER the first time it's displayed
frame_rate_calc = 1

## Define font to use
font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX

# Initialize camera object and video feed from the camera. The video stream is set up
# as a seperate thread that constantly grabs frames from the camera feed. 
# See VideoStream.py for VideoStream class definition
## IF USING USB CAMERA INSTEAD OF PICAMERA,
## CHANGE THE THIRD ARGUMENT FROM 1 TO 2 IN THE FOLLOWING LINE:
videostream = VideoStream.VideoStream((IM_WIDTH,IM_HEIGHT),FRAME_RATE,2,0).start()
time.sleep(1) # Give the camera time to warm up
